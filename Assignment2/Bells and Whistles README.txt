CSE P 576 Project 2, Spring 2013
Jeff Weiner (JDWeiner@UW.edu)

Used one late day.  Completed one bell and one whistle this time around:

Whistle #1: Stitched together Rainier1.png-Rainier6.png and named it
            RainierPanorama.png.

Bell #1:    I created my own panorama, using photos from a trip to Paris in
            2010.  Stitched together six photos from the top of the Eiffel
            Tower, and named it OwnPictureStitching.png.
